# Weather Dashboard
## homework 6

# Description
I have created a weather dashboard for any searchable city. The dashboard will display the current day forecast, along with a 5-day forecast. The temperature is in degrees F, wind speed is MPH, and the UV index has an image showing the severity of the current UV. When you search a city, a button is added below to show the previous city searched. 

# Usage
When you open the page, you are displayed with a blank screen

Here is the search bar

Once a search has been initiated, you will see the current forecast.

We also see the 5-day forecast

And a button will be added below the search bar

# Problems I faced
Well, a lot of our API keys would not work for the 5 day forecast function, so that was an obstcle to get around. For some reason, my buttons would populate in doubles, and neither my tutor or I could figure out how to fix it! My local storage seems to be working properly, but it took awhile to get the local storage data to display on the button.

# Technologies used
HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery and openweathermap.org

# Credits
openweathermap.org is where all of our weather data is from. We used APIs to access that. We had a solid team effort trying to get our codes to work, so I'd like to thank the #potato_gang for helping me in my struggles.
